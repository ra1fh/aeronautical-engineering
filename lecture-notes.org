*** Lecture 1: Introduction and Ballooning
**** Gas Law

*Base Formulas*

$$p V = n R  T$$

  p: pressure PA
  V: Volume m^3
  n: Number of moles
  R: Universial Gas constant in $\frac{J}{mol * K}$
  T: Temperature K

$\rho = \frac{m}{V}$ => $V = \frac{m}{\rho}$

  $\rho$: density
  m: mass
  V: Volume

$m = n M$ => $n = \frac{m}{M}$

  n: number of mols
  M: mass per mol

*Combine to eliminate V and n*

$$n = \frac{m}{M}$$

$$p \frac{m}{\rho} = \frac{m}{M} * R * T$$

$\frac{p}{\rho} = \frac{R}{M} T$ => $p = \rho \frac{R}{M}T$

$\frac{R}{M}$: specific gas constant $R_{specific}$, dependent on gas type only

$p = \rho R_{specific} T$ (equation of state)

R: specific gas constant

$R_{specific} = 287.00 \frac{J}{kg K}$ for air

**** Ballooning

Volume of air/gas.

max force $F_L = m g = \rho_{air} V g$ with $m = \rho V$

ballon $F_L = \rho_{air} V g - \rho_{gas} V g - F_{gplayload}$

lift of balloon: $F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{\rho_{gas}}{\rho_{atm}} )$

assumption: $p_{inside} = p_{outside}$ (true for some ballons, but not all)

$\rho_1 \frac{R}{M_1} T_1 = \rho_2 \frac{R}{M_2} T_2$ => $\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_2} = \frac{T_2}{T_1} \frac{M_1}{M_2}$

*gas ballon:*

$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{\rho_{gas}}{\rho_{atm}} )$ => $F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{M_{gas}}{M_{air}} )$

M_he = 4.0 g/mol
M_air = 28.97 g/mol
M_h2 = 2.0 g/mol

ratio (air helium): 1/7

$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g * \frac{6}{7}$

*for hot air balloon*

$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{\rho_{gas}}{\rho_{atm}} )$ => $F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{T_{atm}}{T_{gas}} )$

with $T_{gas} = T_{atm} + \Delta T$

$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( 1 - \frac{T}{T + \Delta T} )$
$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g ( \frac{T + \Delta T}{T + \Delta T} - \frac{T}{T + \Delta T} )$
$F_L = \rho_{atm} V g \frac{\Delta T}{T + \Delta T}$

to get same amount of lift as helium ballon:

$\frac{\Delta T}{T + \Delta T} = 6/7$ => $\Delta T = 6 T$ => lift of hot air usually much smaller then helium

*** Lecture 2: The Standard Atmosphere
**** standard athmosphere I
as a function of altitude we need:
- pressure p [Pa]
- air density $\rho$ [kg/m^3]
- temperature T [K]

physically correct, so it obeys
- equation of state: $p = \rho R T$ R = 287.00 J/kgK
- pressure increase due to gravity

model athmosphere:
- weather ignored

$\Sigma F_{down} = \Sigma F_{up}$
$mg + (p + \Delta p) A = p A$
$\rho \cdot A \cdot \Delta h \cdot g = p A - p A - \Delta p A$
$\rho \cdot \Delta h \cdot g = - \Delta p$
$\Delta p = - \rho \cdot g \cdot \Delta h$ (only true for small discs, small delta, small altitude)
$dp = -\rho\ g\ dh$

two equations:
- equation of state: $p = \rho R T$
- hydrostatic equation: $dp = -\rho\ g\ dh$

needed:
- need to define temperature as function of altitude
- define start value for pressure

Sea level (h = 0m):
$p_0 = 101325\ Pa$
$T_0 = 15^{\circ} C = 288.15K$
$\rho_0 = 1.225 \frac{kg}{m^3}$

**** standard athmosphere II
$dp = - \frac{p}{R T}\ g\ dh$
$\frac{1}{p}dp = - \frac{g}{RT} dh$

$T_1 = T_0 + a(h_1 - h_0)$ (formula of Toussaint)

$a = \frac{dT}{dh}$
$dh = \frac{dT}{a}$

$\frac{1}{p} dp = - \frac{g}{R} \frac{1}{T} \frac{dT}{a}$

$\int_{p_0}^{p_1} \frac{1}{p} dp = - \frac{g}{aR} \int_{T_0}^{T_1} \frac{1}{T} dT$


$\ln p_1 - \ln p_0 = - \frac{g}{aR} (\ln T_1 - \ln T_0)$

$e^{\ln p_1 - \ln p_0} = e^{-\frac{g}{a R}(\ln T_1 - ln T_0)}$

$\frac{e^{\ln p_1}}{e^{\ln p_0}} = (e^{\ln T_1 - \ln T_0})^{-\frac{g}{a R}}$

$\frac{p_1}{p_0} = (\frac{T_1}{T_0})^{- \frac{g}{a R}}$ with $p = \rho R T$

$\frac{\rho_1 R T_1}{\rho_0 R T_0} = (\frac{T_1}{T_0})^{- \frac{g}{a R}}$

$\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0} = (\frac{T_1}{T_0})^{- \frac{g}{a R} - 1}$ works only for a != 0, need separate equation for isothermal layer.

unit of a: K/m

for isothermal layer:
$\frac{p_1}{p_0} = e^{- \frac{g}{R T} (h_1 - h_0)}$

$\frac{\rho_1}{\rho_0} = e^{- \frac{g}{R T} (h_1 - h_0)}$

**** Geopotential and Geometric altitude
- geopotential altitude h , assumption g0 = constant
- geometric altitude h_g, g varies

$g_0 = \frac{G M_e}{R_e^2}$

$g = \frac{G M_e}{(R_e + h_G)^2}$

$\frac{g}{g_0} = \frac{R_e^2}{(R_e + h_G)^2}$

$dh = \frac{g}{g_0}dh_g = \frac{R_e^2}{(R_e + h_g)^2} dh_g$

$\int_0^h dh = \int_0^{h_g} \frac{R_e^2}{(R_e + h_g)^2} dh_g$

$h = \frac{R_e}{R_e + h_g} h_g$

$R_e = 6378000m = 6378km$
*** Lecture 3: How aircraft fly
Forces on aircraft:
- lift L <=> weight W
- thrust T <=> drag D

$L=W$
$T=D$

**** Lift

$L = C_L \frac{1}{2}\rho V^2 S$ in Newton!!!

$C_L$   = Lift coefficient [no dimension]
$\rho$    = Air density [kg/m^3]
$V$   = velocity [m/s]
$S$   = Wing surface area [m^2]

Lift coefficient $C_L$:
- efficiency of the airfoil in generating lift
- depends on airfoil and angle of attack
- airfoil described by NACA notation
- thickness, camber, chrord, thickness

Where does the lift come from?
- Bernoulli's law: sum of static and dynamic pressure is constant
  $p + \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 = constant$
- Higher velocity means lower pressure
- Nasa foilsim

Take off and landing:
- less lift because speed is low
- add high lift devices
- flaps back of wing
- slats front of wing

**** Drag

$D = C_D \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S$

$C_D$ = Drag coefficient

    = Profile drag + Parasitic drag
    = Pressure drag + Friction drag + Parasitic drag
$\rho$   = Air density [kg/m^3]
$V$  = Velocity [m/s]
$S$  = Wing surface area [m^2]

$C_D(C_L) = C_{D_0} + \frac{C_L^2}{\pi A e}$

e: Oswald efficiency number
A: aspect ratio

$A = \frac{b^2}{S} = \frac{b}{c}$

b: wingspan
S: wing area
c: chord

As angle of attack increases, $C_D$ increases as well as $C_L$.
- maximum $C_L/C_D$ ratio is called glide ratio
- for optimum flight, stay close to optimum glide ratio

**** Thrust and Weight

Engine types:
- piston engines
- turboprop
- turbojet
- turbofan
- ramjet

Fly regimes:
- high and slow: no option, not enough lift
- high and fast: civil aviation
- low  and slow: possible, high lift and low drag, small planes
- low  and fast: inefficient, military does anyway

- Aircraft empty weight:
  - structure
  - systems
  - crew
  - operating itmes
- Payload
- Fuel

** Week 2
*** Lecture 4: Cockpits and Navigation
**** Cockpits
- 747 (1970). three persons in cockpit
- 747-400. glass cockpit
- circuit breakers to switch off individual systems
- mode control panel, central, auto pilot, height, direction
**** Instruments
Units:
- 1 nm = 1852 m nautical miles
- 1 ft = 0.3048 m altitude
- 1 kts = 1 nm/h = 1852m/3600s = 0.51444 m/s
- 1 ft/min = 0.3048m/60s = 0.00508 m/s (1500 ft/min regular speed)
- 0°C = 273.15 K
- mach:

$M = \frac{V_{TAS}}{a}$ a = speed of sound

$a=\sqrt{\gamma R T}$  # speed of sound

$\gamma = 1.4$      # some constant

$R = 287.00J/kgK$

Measuring speed
- air speed
- ground speed
- pitot tube
- whole in the front: dynamic pressure
- opening in the side, static opening, lower pressure, static pressure

$P_{tot} = P_{st} + P_{dyn}$

$P_{tot} = P_{st} + \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2$

- static pressure used to measure altutide
- static pressure also used to measure vertical speed
- air density is included, assumed to be constant
- equivalent air speed (EAS) with assumed rho at sea level
- true air speed (TAS)
- relationship between EAS and TAS:

$\frac{1}{2} \rho_0 V_{EAS}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho V_{TAS}^2$

$V_{TAS} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_0}{\rho}} V_{EAS}$

- in cockpit no conversion, EAS is show, because it's a measure for the
  dynamic pressure

39286.90249007389

**** Instruments II
Measuring altitude
- static pressure
- altitude: relative to sea level QNH
- flight level: uses standard reference of 1013.25 hPa QNE
- height: altitude above airport QFE
- altitude referes to altitude above sea level
- above the transition altitude, flight level (FL) are used
- flight levels, in 100ft, are relative to 1013.25 hPA

Examples
- FL085 means 8500ft above 101325 Pa
- 8500ft means 8500ft above sea level

Navigation
- difference between true north and magnetic north
- magnetic north pole wanders around
- maps and variation are updated yearly

What's our heading
- compass + deviation = magnetic
- magnetic + variation = true
- heading + wind = track
*** Lecture 5: Structural Concepts
**** Early structures

| Period     | Structures                 | Materials          |
|------------+----------------------------+--------------------|
| 1903-1920  | cables, lath, fabric       | steel, wood, linen |
| 1910-1920  | truss, spar, ribs, fabrics | steel rods, tubes  |
| 1920-1940  | Load-carrying wooden wings | Wood               |
| 1932-today | Stiffened shell structures | Aluminium          |
| 1948-today | Pressure cabin             | Improved Al-alloys |
| 1980-today | Composite structures       | Carbon fibres      |

**** From truss to beam

- I-Beam
- Flanges

**** Shell structures
- Boeing and Dougles made first all metal aircraft 1935
- Rivets for joins
- load bearing skins
- monocoque - only load bearing skin
- semi-monocoque - with some supporting elements

Principal structure elements (PSE)
- principal structural elements, primary structure, carries loads,
  failure is catastrophic
- non-principial structural element, secondary structure, failure
  non-catastrophic, hatches, fairings

- Limit load: experienced once in a lifetime of a aircraft, no
  remaining damage allowed
- Ultimate load: limit load x safety factor (1.5), failure allowed
  after 3 seconds
- Failure behavior
- elastic behaviour, deformation reversible
- plastic behaviour, deformation permanent
- higher safety factor for composite than for metal alloy

**** Fatigue
Force equilibrium on hull:

$\Delta p = p_2 - p_1$

$2 \sigma t = \int(\Delta p \cdot R sin \phi)d\phi$

$2\sigma t = \Delta p \cdot 2 R$

$\delta_{circ} = \frac{\Delta p R}{t}$

$\Delta p$: pressure difference
$R$: radius of hull cylinder
$t$: thickness

$\sigma \cdot 2 \pi R \cdot t = \Delta p \cdot \pi R^2$

$\sigma_{long} = \frac{\Delta p R}{2 t}$

$\frac{\sigma_{circ}}{\sigma_{long}} = 2$

Fatigue
- due to repetetive loading
- load, smaller than breaking load, destroys parts
- failure stress for brittle aluminium reduces with number of cycles
- usually indication is cracks
- two limits: visibility limit (detection), criticality limit (failure)

Locations: Wings
- remous (wind variation)
- manoevres
- flaps, thrust

Location: Fuselage
- Pressurisation (once per flight)
- Wing loads

*** Lecture 6: Stability and Control
**** Controls
Wing warping
Control surfaces

Flight controls:
- Thrust, speed control
- Ailerons, bank angle control
- Elevator, nose up/down pitchg
- Rudder, controls yawing movement, heading
- only 4 controls, but 6 degrees of freedom

Fly by wire:
- no direct connection between stick and control surfaces
- computer inbetween

**** Angles and Axes
Body axes
- Xb forward direction axes
- Yb wing on the right side
- Zb pointing down
- Xb rotation: roll or bank angle
- Yb rotation: pitch angle
- Zb rotation: yaw

Sing convention: negative deflection is positive aircraft response

Rudder
- yaw angle $\psi$
- rudder angle $-\delta_r$

Aileron
- roll angle $\phi$
- aileron angle $-\delta_{a,r}, -\delta_{a,l}$

Elevator
- pitch angle $\theta$
- elevator angle $-\delta_e$

Stability axes: $X_s$ attached to velocity
Body axes: $X_b$ attached to aircraft
Horizon reference
- climb angle $\gamma$: horizon -> airspeed
- angle of attack $\alpha$: airspeed -> aircraft
- pitch angle $\theta$: horizon -> aircraft

$\theta = \alpha + \gamma$

Top view (angles in clock direction):
- sideslip angle $\beta$: aircraft -> airspeed
- course $\chi$: north -> airspeed
- heading $\psi$: north -> aircraft

Moments:
- $M$ moment around Y axis, pitching moment
  positive pitching moment with nose up
- $L$ moment around X axis
- $N$ moment aroung Z axis

Lift formula:

$L = C_L \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S$

Coefficient only depends on shape and angle of attack
**** Stability
Static stability
- positive (self-stabilizing)
- neutral
- negative (unstable)

Dynamic stability even if statically stable
- positive (damped)
- neutral (oscillation will keep amplitude)
- negative (oscillation will increase)

Integrators in the control loop, makes control harder
- mode 1: control speed, int -> x
- mode 2: control accelleration, int -> v -> int -> x
- mode 3: control change of acceleration, int -> a -> int -> v -> int ->x
**** Longitudal stability
- upward turbulence: $\Delta \alpha > 0$
- to get aircraft stable again, need $\Delta C_m < 0$

$C_{m_\alpha} = \frac{dC_m}{d\alpha} < 0$

- tail of aircraft can be pitched up with a trim wheel $i_h$
- trim used to get the total moment at center of gravity to zero
- downwash angle of tail $\epsilon$ slightly less

$\alpha_h = \alpha + i_h - \epsilon$

$\alpha_h$ : angle of attack at tail surface
$\alpha$: angle of attack at main wing
$i_h$: trim angle of tail surface
$\epsilon$: downwash angle due main wing changing the airflow direction slightly

$\frac{d\alpha_h}{d\alpha} = \frac{d}{d\alpha}(\alpha + i_h - \epsilon) = 1 - \frac{d\epsilon}{d\alpha}$

Aerodynamic centre:
- The point around whiche there is no change in moment due to a change
  in the angle of attack
- The moment stays constant for changing $\alpha$ at aerodynamic centre
- Lift might change due to angle of attack change
- nose up: positive moment

[[./longitudal-stability-1.png]]

Weight/Lift equation in equilibrium:

$W = L_{wb} + L_H = L$

Moment equation in equilibrium:

$\sum M_{tot} = M_{ac} + L_{wb} \cdot l_{cg} - L_H \cdot (l_H - l_{cg})$

$\sum M_{tot} = M_{ac} + L \cdot l_{cg} - L_H l_H = 0$

$C_m = \frac{M}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S c}$

$c$: average court, wing area divided by span

$C_m = C_{mac} + C_L \frac{l_{cg}}{c} - \frac{C_{L_H} \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S_H l_H}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S c}$

$C_m = C_{mac} + C_L \frac{l_{cg}}{c} - C_{L_H} \cdot V_H$ with

$V_H = \frac{S_H l_H}{S\cdot c}$ tail volume

$\frac{d C_m}{d \alpha} = 0 + \frac{dC_L}{d \alpha} \cdot \frac{l_{cg}}{c} - \frac{dC_{LH}}{d \alpha} \cdot V_H$

$C_{m_\alpha} = a \cdot \frac{l_{cg}}{c} - a_t (1 - \frac{d\epsilon}{d\alpha}) V_H < 0$

$a\frac{l_{cg}}{c} < a_t ( 1 - \frac{ d\epsilon} {d \alpha} ) V_H$

Total definition of longitudial stability:

$\frac{l_{cg}}{c} < \frac{a_t}{a} ( 1 - \frac{d \epsilon}{d \alpha} ) V_H$

when left and right part are equal: neutral point
$V_H$ is design parameter, it includes tail surface, distance to tail.

$V_H = \frac{S_H l_h}{S \cdot c}$

distance between neutral point and center of gravity is called static
margin. Can be changed by moving centre of gravity (all run to the
front of an aircraft). Static margin should be positive. This is true
for conventional aircraft. For canard aircraft there are some changes.

**** Aircraft oscillations

- up down movement
- period: 30 sec - several minutes
- low or no damping
- exchange kinetic and potential engergy
- modern airliners: low drag, low damping

Short period
- preriod: 2-5 seconds
- reaction on disturbance
- modern airliners: high damping

Dutch roll
- left right swing
- little damped

Spiral

Aperiodic roll
- result of vertical tail on top
** Week 3
*** Lecture 7: Propulsion introduction
**** Intro
$V_0$: speed the air enters the engine, airspeed
$V_J$: exit speed

$V_j > V_0$ => thrust

Momentum
$I=mV$

$F = \frac{dI}{dt} = \frac{d(mV)}{dt} = \dot{m}\Delta V$

$T = \dot{m}(V_j - V_0)$

$\dot{m}$: Mass Flow in kg/s

$V_j - V_0$: speed change (m/s)

Mass flow calculation via Volume

$\dot{m} = \rho_{air} \cdot A \cdot V_{TAS}$

area: $A = \pi r^2$ or similar

Engine types:
- human-powered
- electric
- airbreathing engines
  - prop
  - jet
- rocket

**** Airbreathing engines
Piston engine
- piston moves
- buring fuel causing pressure
- causes piston to move

$F = p \cdot A$

$A$: area of piston
$F$: force
$p$:  pressure on piston

$W = F \cdot s$

$W$ work
$s$ travelled way

$W = F \cdot \Delta x$
$W = p A \cdot \Delta x$
$W = p \cdot \Delta V$

$V$ Volume

$W = \int p d V$

Cycles:
- Intake
- Compression
- Combustion
- Expansion
- Exhaust

Area on p/V graph equals to amount of Work W

Aviation piston engines 
- 2 stroke engines *obsolete*
- 4 stroke engines *common*
- wankel engine *new*
- diesel engine *new*

Layouts:
- in-line engines
- radial engine
- boxer engine
- v-engine

**** Propeller theory
Convert shaft energy into propulsive energy

Increase efficiency
- counter-rotation
- variable pitch
- ducted fan

$V = \omega r$

$\omega$: rad/s

Useful force: T thrust
Loss: S side force (like drag)

Propeller pitch:
- speed varies
- angle of attack needs to vary as well
- variable twist
- adjustable pitch to accomodate different air speed

Propeller power

Work performed: $W = T \Delta s$ [J] = [Nm]

Power available: $P_a = \frac{T\Delta s}{\Delta t} = T \cdot V$ [J/s] = [W]

Brake (shaft) power: $P_{br}$

Propulsive efficiency: $\eta = \frac{P_a}{P_{br}} = \frac{T V}{P_{br}}$

$V$ is speed of the aircraft here

**** Jet engines
- continuous combustion
- intake -> compressed -> heated -> exapanded -> exhaust

Ramjet:
- air compressed due to airspeed
- not very efficient

Turbofan:
- compressor
- more compression
- more thrust due to move pV area

Turboprop/turboshaft
- turbine connected to propeller via gearbox
- loose some energy due to gearbox
- propeller more efficient than jet engine
- also used for helicopters

Turbofan
- extra fan in front of turbine
- some cold air bypasses turbine

Bypass ratio

$Bypass ratio B = \frac{Bypass airflow (cold)}{Core airflow (hot)} = \frac{\dot{m_c}}{\dot{m_h}}$

- more cold air
- less hot aur

Propulsive efficiency

In: $\frac{1}{2} \dot{m} V_0^2$

Out: $\frac{1}{2} \dot{m}V_j^2$

Jet Power: $P_j = \frac{1}{2} \dot{m} ( V_j^2 - V_0^2)$

Jet thrust: $T = \dot{m}(V_j - V_0)$

Power available: $P_a = T V_0$

Jet efficiency: $\eta_j = \frac{P_a}{P_j} = \frac{ T V_0} { \frac{1}{2} \dot{m} (V_j^2 - V_0^2) }$

Jet efficiency: $\eta_j = \frac{2V_0}{V_0 + V_j} = \frac{2}{1 + V_j/V_0}$

Efficiency:
- more mass flow
- lower exhaust speed
- much higher propulsive efficiency
- mixing of air also decreases noise level

Two or four engines:
- ETOPS: Extended Twin OperationS
- "engines turning or passengers swimming"
- due to higher reliability of modern engines
- twin engines restricted to maximum diversion time
- crossing some parts of atlantic and pacific ocean and the poles
  still restricted to four engine aircrafts

Future:
- even bigger engines
- turboprops, greener but noisier
- scramjet? not very efficient, but lower drag to outer atmosphere
  supersonic combustion ram jet -> scramjet
- specialization

Speed of sound $a = \sqrt{\gamma
 RT}$

| Subsonic   | M < 0.8       |
| Transsonic | 0.8 < M < 1.2 |
| Supersonic | 1.2 < M < 5   |
| Hypersonic | M > 5         |

Subsonic
- sound moves faster than object
- no coalesce of waves (sound or pressure)
- doppler effect

Speed equal to sound
- coalescence of waves
- shock wave/pressure step
- sound barrier
- higher drag on the aircraft

Supersonic
- coalescences of waves
- shock wave /pressure step
- mach angle $\mu$

$sin \mu = \frac{a\Delta t}{V\delta t} = \frac{a}{V} = \frac{1}{M}$

$\mu = sin^{-1}(\frac{1}{M})$

Shock waves
- reduction of lift
- increase in (wave) drag

Improve supersonic flight
- thin airfoils, extend subsonic flow, increase critical Mach number
  (3-5% of chord length)
- wing sweep, reduces the drag coefficient at supersonic speed, some
  aircraft can change sweep during flight

**** The limits of speed

** Week 4
*** Lecture 1: Fundamentals of Aerodynamics
**** Fundamental Equations 1
Pressure
    $p = \lim\limits_{dA \to 0} \left(\frac{dF}{dA}\right) \left[\frac{N}{m^2}\right]$ or Pa

Density
    $\rho = \lim\limits_{dv \to 0} \left(\frac{dm}{dv}\right) \left[\frac{kg}{m^3}\right]$

Temperature
    $KE = \frac{3}{2}kT$

    Measure of the average kinetic energy of the particle in the gas.

    $k = 1.38 \cdot 10^{-23}\frac{J}{K}$ Boltzmann constant

Equation of state

    $p = \rho R T$

    $R = 287.0 \frac{J}{kg \cdot K}$ gas constant

Standard conditions

    $p_s = 1.01325 \cdot 10^5 \frac{N}{m^2} = 1 atm$

    $\rho_s = 1.225\frac{kg}{m^3}$

    $T_s = 288.15 K$

    $0^ \circ C = 273.15 K$

Specific volume

    $v = \frac{1}{\rho}$      volume per 1 kg (I guess)

    $p v = RT$   alternative equation of state

Velocity and streamlines

    velocity in point B is the velocity of an infinitesimally small
    fluid element a sweeps through B.

    $\vec{v} = \frac{d\vec{s}}{dt}$

Velocity and streamlines (s)
- airfoil
- air above and below
- dividing point, stagnation point (V = 0)
- stagnation pressure, total pressure

Aerodynamic forces
- friction force as air moves over the surface
- airfoil object displaces the fluid, pressure forces on the surface

**** Fundamental Equations 2

Continuity equation for steady flow

    $\dot{m}_{in} = \dot{m}_{out}$

Continuity equation

    Velocity $V$
    Area $A$
    Timespan $dT$

    $m = \rho \cdot Volume$

    $Volume = V \cdot dt \cdot A$

    $\dot{m} = \frac{\rho A V dt}{dt} = \rho A V$

    $\rho A V = constant$

    $\rho_1 A_1 V_1 = \rho_2 A_2 V_2$

    $\rho$ and V are mean values over the area

For incompressible flow (same $\rho$)

    $A\cdot V = constant$

Euler equation

    Newton's second law: $F = m \cdot a$

    The force in x-direction

    $F = pdydz - \left(p + \frac{dp}{dx}dx \right) dydz$

    $F = - \frac{dp}{dx}dxdydz$ Force on fluid element due to pressure

    The mass m of the fluid element is

    $m = \rho \cdot Vol = \rho 
dxdydz$

    Acceleration a of the fluid element:

    $a = \frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dx} \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{dV}{dx}V$

    $- \frac{dp}{dx}(dxdydz) = \rho (dxdydz) V \frac{dV}{dx}$

    $dp = - \rho V dV$ (Euler equation)

Keep in mind:
- gravity neglected
- viscosity neglected
- steady flow
- flow may be compressible

**** Bernoulli's principle
Integrating the Euler equation along a streamline

$$dp + \rho V dV = 0$$

$$\int_{p_1}^{p_2}dp + \int_{V_1}^{V_2} \rho V dV = 0$$

$$(p_2 - p_1) + \rho \left(\frac{1}{2} V_2^2 - \frac{1}{2}V_1^2 \right) = 0$$

$$p1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V_1^2 = p_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V_2^2$$

$$p + \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 =$$ constant along a streamline
static pressure + dynamic pressure = total pressure

=> Bernoulli's principle

Pitot tube

$$V=\sqrt{\frac{2q}{\rho}}$$
*** Lecture 2: Compressibility
**** Thermodynamics

- System, boundary, surroundings
- Change to internal energy e can be from work done on the system or
  heat change

First law of thermodynamics

    $e$: energy
    $\delta q$: heat change
    $\delta w$: work done on or from system

    $$de = \delta q + \delta w $$

Work done on the system

    work = force * distance
    work = pressure * area * distance
    work = $p \cdot dA \cdot s$

    $$\partial w = \int_A pdAs = p \int_A sdA$$

    $$\partial w = -pdv$$ (for reversible process)

    $dv$: change in volume

    note negative sign, decreasing volume created by work to the system


  hence:

    $$de = \partial q - pdv$$

Enthalpy h

    Measure of the total energy of the system

    $$ h = e + pv $$

    $$ dh = de + d(pv) $$

    $$ dh = de + pdv + vdp $$

    $$ de = \partial q - pdv $$

  hence:

    $$ dh = \partial q + vdp $$

Processes
- constant pressure process
- constant volume process

Specific heat

    $$ c = \frac{\partial q}{d T} $$    

    c depends on type of process

    $$ c_v = \left( \frac{\partial q}{dT}\right) $$

    $$ c_p = \left( \frac{\partial q}{dT} \right) $$

Constant volume process (dv = 0)

    $$de = \partial q = c_vdT$$

    $$e = c_v T$$ (e=0 at T=0)


Constant pressure process (dp = 0)

    $$dh = \partial q = c_pdT$$

    $$h = c_pT$$ (integrated with h=0 at T=0)

Summary

    $$de = c_v dT$$

    $$dh = c_p dT$$

    $$e = c_v T$$

    $$h = c_p T$$

    $$c_v = 720 \frac{J}{kg \cdot K}$$ for air and T <600K
    $$c_p = 1008 \frac{J}{kg \cdot K}$$

**** Isentropic flows
Definitions:
- adiabatic process: no heat addition or subtraction, $\partial q = 0$
- reversible process: no frictional or dossopative effects
- isentropic process: both adiabatic and reversible

For isentropic flow of a perfect gas:

    $$de = \partial q - pdv$$

    $$\partial q = 0 \Rightarrow - pdv = de = c_v dT$$

    $$\partial q = dh - vdp$$

    $$\partial q = 0 \Rightarrow dh = vdp = c_p dT$$

Ratio of specific heats

    $$\frac{-pdv}{vdp} = \frac{c_v}{c_p} \Rightarrow \frac{dp}{p} = -\left(\frac{c_p}{c_v}\right) \frac{dv}{v}$$

Now define the ratio pf specific heats:

    $$\gamma = \frac{c_p}{c_v}$$

    $$\gamma = 1.4$$ for air

    $$\Rightarrow \frac{dp}{p} = -\gamma\frac{dv}{v}$$

Isentropic flow:

    $$\ln \left( \frac{p_2}{p_1} \right) = - \gamma \ln 
\left( \frac{v_2}{v_1} \right)$$

    $$\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right) = \left(\frac{v_2}{v_1}\right)^{-\gamma}$$


Since $v = \frac{1}{\rho}$:

    $$\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}\right)^{\gamma}$$ (only for insentropic flow)

Using $p = \rho R T$:

    $$\left(\frac{p_2}{p_1}\right)^{1-\gamma} = \left( \frac{T_1}{T_2} \right)^\gamma$$

    $$\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}\right)^\gamma = \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}}$$

    only relevant for compressible flow

Energy equation

    $$h + \frac{1}{2} V_2 = constant $$

    $$c_pT + \frac{1}{2} V^2 = constant$$

Summary for steady, frictionless, incompressible flow:

    $$A_1 V_1 = A_2 V_2$$     continuity equation

    $$p_1 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V_1^2 = p_2 + \frac{1}{2} \rho V_2^2$$    Bernoulli's equation

    $$p_1 = \rho_1 R T_1$$     $$p_2 = \rho_2 R T_2$$  equation of state


Summary for steady,  isentropic, compressible flow

    $$\rho_1 A_1 V_1 = \rho_2 A_2 V_2$$            continuity equation


    $$\frac{p_2}{p_1} = \left(\frac{\rho_2}{\rho_1}\right)^\gamma = \left( \frac{T_2}{T_1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}}$$    isentropic relations

    $$c_pT_1 + \frac{1}{2} V_1^2 = c_pT_2 + \frac{1}{2} V_2^2$$    energy equation

    $$p_1 = \rho_1 R T_1$$     $$p_2 = \rho_2 R T_2$$  equation of state

**** Speed of sound
Continuity eqation applied to sound wave

    $$a
 = -\rho \frac{da}{d\rho}$$

Momentum equation

    $$a^2 = \frac{dp}{d\rho}$$

    - no heat addition
    - friction negligible small
    => isentropic

Speed of sound

    $$a = \sqrt{\gamma RT}$$

    - speed of sound in perfect gas only depends on T

Mach number

    $$M = \frac{V}{a}$$

| M        |            |
|----------+------------|
| < 0.8    | subsonic   |
| 1        | sonic      |
| around 1 | transonic  |
| > 1      | supersonic |
| > 5      | hypersonic |

Second form of isentropic relations when V_0 = 0

    $$\frac{T_0}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_1^2$$

    $$\frac{p_0}{p_1} = \left( 1 + \frac{\gamma -1}{2} M_1^2 \right)^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1}$$

    $$\frac{\rho_0}{\rho_1} = \left( 1 + \frac{\gamma -1}{2} M_1^2 \right)^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1}$$

**** Supersonic nozzles

Compressibility
- for M < 0.3 the change in density is less than 5%
- for M < 0.3 flow considered incompressible
    
Area velocity relation

    $$\frac{dA}{A} = (M^2 - 1) \frac{dV}{V}$$

**** Supersonic wind tunnel

Wind tunnel to get M=3

Reservoir pressure, use second form of isentropic relations:

    $$\frac{p_0}{p_1} = \left( 1 + \frac{\gamma -1}{2} M_1^2 \right)^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1}$$

    $$p_0 = p_{ts} \left( 1 + \frac{\gamma -1}{2} M_{ts}^2 \right)^\frac{\gamma}{\gamma -1}$$

    $$p_0 = 36.73 atm $$

Reservoir temperature

    $$\frac{T_0}{T_1} = 1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_1^2$$

    $$T_0 = T_{ts} \left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M_{ts}^2 \right)$$

    $$T_0 = 288.15 \cdot \left(1 + \frac{1.4 - 1}{2}3^2 \right) = 806.82 K$$

Test section flow speed

    $$ M = \frac{V}{a} \Rightarrow  V = Ma$$

    $$V_{ts} = M \sqrt{\gamma R T_{ts}}$$

    $$V_{ts} = 3 \sqrt{1.4 \cdot 287 \cdot 288.15} = 1020.79 \frac{m}{s}$$

Flow speed in the throat

In the throat: M = 1 $$\Rightarrow V^* = a^*$$

    $$a^* = \sqrt{\gamma R T^*}$$


    $$T^* = T_0 \left(1 + \frac{\gamma - 1}{2}M^{*2}\right)^{-1}
$$

    $$T^* = 672.35 K $$


Velocity in the throat

     $$V^* = \sqrt{1.4 \cdot 287 \cdot 672.35} = 519.76 \frac{m}{s}$$

Expansion ratio

     $$\rho_{ts} A_{ts} V_{ts} = \rho^* A^* V^*$$

     $$\frac{A_{ts}}{A^*} = \frac{\rho^* V^*}{\rho_{ts} V_{ts}}$$

     $$\frac{\rho^*}{\rho_{ts}} = \left( \frac{T^*}{T_{ts}} \right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma -1}} = \left(\frac{672.35}{288.15}\right)^{\frac{1}{1.4-1}} = 8.32$$

     $$\frac{A_{ts}}{A^*} = 8.32 * \frac{519.76}{1020.79} = 4.23$$
*** Lecture 3: Viscous Flow
**** Viscous flows
- Osborne Reynolds (1842-1912)
- Pipe flow experiment
- Laminar/Turbulent Flow
- Reynolds number

  $$\mathtt{Re} = \frac{\rho \cdot V \cdot D}{\mu}$$

  $\rho$: density of fluid (kg/m^3)
  $V$: velocity (m/s)
  $D$: linear dimension, diameter for pipe (m)
  $\mu$: dynamic viscosity of the fluid (Pa*s or N*s/m^2 or kg(m*s))

  At Re < 2300: laminar flow
     Re > 4000: turbulent flow

  Water at 20°C:
  $\mu = 1.002 \cdot 10^{-3} \mathtt{Pa} \cdot \mathtt{s}$
  $\rho = 998.2071 \frac{kg}{m^3}$

  Air at 15°C:
  $$\mu = 1.81 \cdot 10^{-5} \mathtt{Pa} \cdot \mathtt{s}$$

- Ludwig Prandtl (1875-1953)
- Boundary layer theory
- Bernoulli's principle is for frictionless flow,
  not valid in boundary layer

**** The boundary layer on a flat plate

- shear stress
  $$\tau_w = \mu \frac{du}{dy}$$

  $\mu$: dynamic viscosity of the fluid

- local Reynolds number:

  $$\mathtt{Re}_x = \frac{\rho_\infty V_\infty x}{\mu_\infty}$$

- Laminar flow: Streamlines are smooth and regular, fluid element
  moves smoothly along a streamline

- Turbulent flow: Streamlines break up, fluid element moves in a
  random, irregular way

- Local boundary layer thickness at location x from leading edge is:

  $$\delta = \frac{ 5.2 x}{\sqrt{\mathtt{Re}_x}}$$  => boundary layer develops parabolically

- Total force: total pressure force + total friction force of the plate
  plate is thin => no pressure force

- Total friction drag:

  $$D_f = \int_0^L \tau_w dx$$

- Kinematic viscosity

  $$v = \frac{\mu}{\rho}$$

  $$\mathtt{Re}_L = \frac{V \cdot L}{v}$$      V: velocity L: length


- Skin friction drag laminar flow

  $$D_f = \frac{1.328 \cdot q_\infty \cdot L}{\sqrt{\mathtt{Re}_L}}$$

  $$C_f = \frac{1.328}{\sqrt{\mathtt{Re}_L}}$$         skin friction coefficient on a flat plate
  
  only valid for low speed, incrompressible flow
  reasonably accurate for high speed subsonic flow

- Turbulent boundary layer 

  $$\delta = \frac{0.37 x}{\mathtt{Re}_x^{0.2}}$$

  $$C_f = \frac{0.074}{\mathtt{Re}_L^{0.2}}$$

Laminar vs Turbulent:
- for turbulent flow, C_f varies with L^-1/5
- for laminar flow, C_f varies with L^_1/2
- friction in a turbulent boundary layer is larger than in laminar flow

**** Transition
- critical Reynolds number where laminar flow goes turbulent
- Recr ~ 500000 lower boundary in literature, but varies a lot

- laminar -> transition -> turbulent:
- Tollmien-Schlichting waves
- Spanwise vorticity
- 3D vortex breakdown
- Turbulent spots
- Fully turbulent flow

- Oil drag method, black area indicates where transition to turbulent flow
  has completed

** Week 5
*** Lecture 4: Pressure distribution and flow separation
**** Pressure distributions
Pressure coefficient

    $$C_p = \frac{p - p_0}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V_0^2}$$

    C_p at stagnation point = 1?

**** Flow separation
- Karman vortex street
- Applying roughness to avoid laminar separation resulting lower drag
- Higher Reynold numbers of an airfoil has favorable effect on lift and drag
- E.g. 60000, 120000 and higher
*** Lecture 5: Wing profiles
**** Wings and airfoils

Two dimensional situation, infinitely long airfoil

Wing:
    $$L = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 C_L S$$       Lift

    $$D = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 C_D S$$      Drag

    $$M = \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 C_M Sc$$    Moment


In two dimensional case, S is undefined. So define length as 1m and

    $$S = c \cdot 1 = c$$

Airfoil (note lower case subscript for coefficient):

    $$C_l = \frac{L}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 c}$$

    $$C_d = \frac{D}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 c}$$

    $$C_m = \frac{M}{\frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 c^2}$$
    
Definitions:
- angle of attack: angle between chord line and stream vector
- lift L is perpendicular to stream vector
- drag D is parallel to stream vector
- moment M is positive nose up
- moment is close to "quarter chord point" close to aerodynamic center,
  where the moment doesn't change with varying angle of attack

- C_l over C_d curve
- tangient through 0 and curve shows maximum C_l/C_d ratio, design point C_l
- moment coefficient is negative

- NACA National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (1915)
- NACA 4 digit airfoil series, e.g. NACA 0012
- NACA 6 digit airfoil series 1940s, more laminar flow, better lift/drag ratio

- NASA National Aeronautic and Space Administration, successor of NACA 1958
- LS series 1970s
- NLF series 1980s

**** Pressure distribution and compressibility correction

Normal force accross airfoil per meter span

    $$N = \int_{LE}^{TE} p_l \cos \theta ds - \int_{LE}^{TE} p_u \cos \theta ds$$

    LE: leading edge
    TE: trailing edge
    p_l: force on lower surface
    p_u: force on upper surface

    with $$ds \cos \theta = dx$$:

    $$N = \int_{0}^{c} p_l dx - \int_{0}^{c} p_u dx$$
   

    $$C_n = \frac{N}{\frac{1}{2} V^2_\infty c} = \frac{N}{q_\infty c}$$

    with some more magic:

    $$C_n = \int_0^1 (C_{pl} - C_{pu}) d \left(\frac{x}{c} \right)$$

    For small angle of attack:

    $$C_l \approx \int_0^1 (C_{pl} - C_{pu}) d \left( \frac{x}{c} \right)$$

Prandtl-Glauert rule

    $$C_p = \frac{C_{p,0}}{\sqrt{1 - M_\infty^2}}$$

    $C_p$ compressible pressure coefficient
    $C_{p,0}$ incompressible pressure coefficient

Lift coefficient compressibility correction

    $$C_l = \frac{C_{l,0}}{\sqrt{1-M_\infty^2}} = \frac{C_{l,0}}{\beta}$$

    $C_l$ compressible lift coefficient
    $C_{l,0}$ incompressible lift coefficient

    lift correction rule applicable up to mach number ~ 0.7

*** Lecture 6: Critical Mach number
- flow speed over air flow is high than velocity
- at some point for a velocity << M=1, M=1 is reached over the airfoil
- => critical pressure coefficient, critical mach number
- increasing thickness of airfoil -> higher velocity over airfoil
- flat plate: Mcritical = 1
- thicker airfoil -> C_p goes to more negative values

Relation between critical M and critical C_p

    $$C_p = \frac{2}{\gamma M_\infty^2} \left[ \left( \frac{1 + \frac{1}{2} (\gamma -1) M_\infty^2}{1 + \frac{1}{2} (\gamma -1) M^2} \right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}} - 1 \right]$$

    $M_\infty$ free flow speed
    $M$ speed over airfoil

    when M=1: $M_\infty = M_{crit}$
              $C_p = C_{p,crit}$

When M=1 and $C_p = C_{p,crit}$:

    $$C_{p,crit} = \frac{2}{\gamma M_\infty^2} \left[ \left( \frac{2 + (\gamma -1) M_\infty^2}{ \gamma + 1} \right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma - 1}} - 1 \right]$$

    (airfoil independent curve)

Airfoil dependent curve:

    $$C_{p,min} = \frac{C_{p,0min}}{\sqrt{1-M_\infty^2}}$$

    (intersection with airfoil dependent curve gives critical Mach number

What happens when speed is increased accross critical mach number:
- locally section with supersonic flow will develop
- lower surface will develop supersonic areas as well
- shock waves will appear
- boundary layer will separate when shock is big enough
- => high pressure drag
- Mach number where this start: Mach number for drag divergence
- drag will increase until free stream has reached M=1
- initially people thought drag rise will not end => sound barrier
- when flow is entirely supersonic, C_d reduces again

Supercritical airfoils
- supersonic velocity over large part of upper surface slightly above
  critical C_p so that heavy shocks will be avoided
- weak shocks
- much lower drag

Wing sweep
- due to angle, wing profile, sees reduced speed
- $V = V_\infty \cos \Lambda$
- critical mach number increases
- could also considered differently by looking at the
  increased length in flow direction
- relative thickness decreases
- lowers lift

*** Lecture 7: Finite Wings
**** Finite Wings, induced drag
- flow around wing tips generates tip vortices
- chord line $\alpha$
- incoming free stream flow $V_\infty$
- lift force $L_1$ perpendicular to free stream flow
- wing "sees" stream under $\alpha_{eff} = \alpha - \alpha_{i
}$
- lift vector points backwards by $\alpha_i$
- new lift vector has a drag component
  $$D_i = L \sin \alpha_i$$
- since $$\alpha_i$$ is small: $$\sin \alpha_i \approx \alpha_i$$
  $$D_i = L \alpha_i$$
  $\alpha_i$ in radians

From incompressible flow theory:

    $$\alpha_i = \frac{C_L}{\pi A}$$        with $$A = \frac{b^2}{S}$$

    $$C_{D_i} = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi A}$$

Span efficiency factor

    $$C_{D_i} = \frac{C_L^2}{\pi A e_1}$$     $$e_1$$: Span efficiency factor

    | elliptical loading     | e1 = 1 | minimum induced drag |
    | non-elliptical loading | e1 < 1 | higher induced drag  |

total drag = profile drag + induced drag

    $$C_D = C_d + \frac{C_L^2}{\pi A e_1}$$

Aspect ratio:
- high aspect ratio: low induced drag (glider)
- low aspect ratio: high induced drag

**** Lift-curve slope
Induced angle of attack for general wing

    $$\alpha_i = \frac{C_L}{\pi A e_1}$$  angle in radians (multiply with 57.3 for angle in degrees)

    $$\alpha_i = \frac{57.3\,C_L}{\pi A e_1}$$  angle in degrees

From thin airfoil theory:

    $$a_0 = \frac{d C_l}{d\alpha}$$    lift gradiant for the profile (note small l)

    $$a_0 = 2 \pi /\mathtt{rad} = 0.1097 / \,^\circ$$

    $$a_0 = \frac{dC_L}{d\alpha}$$     lift gradiant for the actual wing (note capital L)

    $$a = \frac{d C_L}{d\alpha} = \frac{a_0}{1 + \frac{a_0}{\pi A e_1}} $$  a_0 per radians

    $$a = \frac{d C_L}{d\alpha} = \frac{a_0}{1 + \frac{57.3 a_0}{\pi A e_1}} $$  a_0 per degree


    $$a_0 = \frac{dC_l}{d\alpha}$$

** Week 6
*** Lecture 1: Introduction to flight mechanics
**** Introduction
- gliding
- fuel
- max min speed
- morphology
**** Equation of Motion
Reference frame: earth surface, earth axis system
- earth is round, centrifugal force
- aircraft flying at 10km height:

  $$a= \frac{V^2}{R}$$

  $$R = R_e + h$$

  $$R = 6371 + 10 = 6381km$$

  $$a = \frac{250^2}{6381 \cdot 10^3} = 0.0097m/s^2$$

- centrifugal accelleration very small: can be neglected
- earth is rotating, very small, can be neglected

More reference frames:
- moving earth reference system, attached to aircraft, but moving along
- body axis system attached to the aircraft axes
  - can observe $\theta$ with respect to horizon
- airspeed vector, angle to horizon: flightpath angle, called airpath axes system

Angles:
- flight path angle \gamma: horizon (moving earth axis) and velocity V
- angle of attack \alpha: aircraft nose to velocity vector V
- pitch angle \theta: aircraft nose to moving earth axis = \gamma + \alpha

$$ F = m \cdot a $$

Forces acting on the aircraft:
- gravitational force w, weight, drawn along z axis of moving earth axis system
- assume constant gravity
  $$F = \frac{\mu M_1 M_2}{R^2}$$

- lift force, perpendicular to airspeed vector
- drag force, parallel to airspeed vetor
- defined in airpath axes system

- thrust force, can be drawn with an angle to airspeed vector
- T: thrust angle of attack

Accelleration:
- free to define in whatever axis system, but airpath axes most convenient
- forward accelleration

  $$\frac{dV}{dt}$$

- perpendicular acceleration

  $$a = \frac{V^2}{R}$$

  $$\omega R = V$$

  $$\omega = \frac{d\gamma}{dt}$$

  $$a = V \frac{d \gamma}{dt}$$    a equal to change of flight path angle

Equation of motions

(1) $$ \sum F_{\|V} : m \frac{dV}{dt} = T \cos \alpha t - D -W \sin \gamma$$    \alpha parallel to flight path: cos \alpha = 1

(1) $$ \sum F_{\|V} : \frac{W}{g} \frac{dV}{dt} = T - D -W \sin \gamma$$

(2) $$ \sum F_{\perp V} : m V \frac{d \gamma}{dt} = L + T \sin \alpha t - W \cos \gamma$$

(2) y$$ \sum F_{\perp V} : \frac{W}{g} V \frac{d \gamma}{dt} = L - W \cos \gamma$$

**** Aerodynamics
Different Variables
- independent: t
- state: $\gamma, V$
- other: $T, L, W, D, \alpha_T$
- try to express variables using state, eliminate variables

Lift-drag polar

    zero lift drag:    $$C_{D_0}$$

    lift-induced drag: $$\frac{C_L^2}{\pi A \Phi}$$

    $$C_D = C_{D_0} + \frac{C_L^2}{\pi A \Phi}$$

    $$A = \frac{b^2}{S}$$:    aspect ratio    

    $$\Phi$$:          span efficiency number

    $$C_D = C_{D_0} + \frac{C_L^2}{\pi A e}$$

    $$e$$: Oswald efficiency factor

Total drag polar
- in essence parabolic equation: $y = ax^2 + b$
- to be more accurate:           $y = ax^2 + bx + c$

Desired: lift and drag as function of airspeed

    $$ D = C_{D_0} \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S + k_1 W + k_2 \frac{W^2}{S} \frac{2}{\rho} \frac{1}{V^2} = f(V^2) + f(\frac{1}{V^2})$$

    - one part decreases with airspeed, other increases with airspeed
    - point of minimum drag
    - induced drag $D_i$ decreases with airspeed
    - zero-lift drag $D_0$ increases with airspeed
    
**** Propulsion
Air breathing engines:
- $$V_0$$ -> $$\dot{m}$$ -> $$V_j$$
- exit mass flow = intake mass flow plus fuel

$$T = (\dot{m} + \dot{m}_f) \cdot V_j - \dot{m} V_0$$ (pressure at exit equal to athmospheric pressure)

$$T = \dot{m} \cdot (V_j - V_0)$$            (simplification without fuel mass flow)

Two options:
- little air and high velocity increase: jet engine
- lot of air with little increase in velocity: propeller

Total efficiency:
$$P_a = TV$$    power available
$$Q = \dot{m}_f H$$   engine input energy (H=energy per unit of fuel)

$$\eta_t = \frac{P_a}{Q}$$

$$P_j = \frac{1}{2} \dot{m} V_j^2 - \frac{1}{2} \dot{m} V_0^2$$   Jet Power


$$\eta_t = \frac{P_a}{Q} = \frac{P_a}{Q} \frac{P_j}{P_j}$$

$$\eta_t = \eta_{th} \cdot \eta_j$$

    with: $$\eta_{th} = \frac{P_j}{Q}$$
          $$\eta_{j}  = \frac{P_a}{P_j}$$

$$\eta_j = \frac{2}{1 + \frac{V_j}{V}} $$    jet efficiency only depends on jet speed and air speed

Example:
A   T = 1000 N
    mdot = 10 kg/s

    T = mdot (V_j - V)
    V_j - V = 100 m/s

    etaj = 2 / (1 + 200/100) = 0.666 = 66.6 %

B   V = 200 m/s
    T = 1000 N
    Vj = 300 m/s
    etaj = 2 / (1 + 300/200) = 0.80 = 80 %

same thrust, same mass flow, very different efficiency. flying faster
improves efficiency for jet engines. => jet engines for high speed flight.
**** Simplified representation of propulsion

$$ T = \dot{m} \cdot ( V_j - V_0) $$

- Thrust const for different airspeed, given throttle const
- with higher air speed, mass flow increases and $$V_j - V_0$$ decreases, cancels out
- for calculation, assume T is const with airspeed for given altitude and throttle
- follows power available becomes staight line over airspeed

For propeller:

$$\eta_j = \frac{P_a}{P_{br}}$$    propeller efficiency = power available / shaft power

$\eta_j$ at various airspeeds can be kept constant by varying the propeller pitch

$P_{br}$ assumed to be constant as well for a given engine

Follows $P_a$ is constant as well independent of flight speed

Analytically:

    $$P_{a_{max}} = \frac{C_D}{C_L} W V$$   C_D is a function of C_L (quadratic eq)
    
    $$P_{a_{max}} = \sqrt{ \frac{W^3}{S} \frac{2}{\rho} \frac{ (C_{D_0} + k_1 C_L + k_2 C_L^2)^2}{C_L^3}}$$

    => solve for C_L 
    => choose smallest C_L (other C_L corresponds to
       impossible condition below $V_{min}$)

    $$V = \sqrt{\frac{W}{S} \frac{2}{\rho} \frac{1}{C_L}}$$
**** Range

Fuel flow

    $$F = c_p P_{br(brake)}$$    $c_p$:  power specific fuel consumption
                        $P_{br}$: power delived at the shaft
                             (break was used to measure the shaft power => brake)

**** Endurance
Maximum time an aircraft can stay in the air
- minimize fuel flow to get maximum endurance
- fuel flow is fuel amount burnt per second
- max endurance E_max

$$ F = c_p P_{br} $$

$$ F = c_p \frac{P_a}{\eta} = c_p \frac{P_a}{\eta}$$       since $$P_a = P_r$$

$$E_{max} \Rightarrow F_{min} \Rightarrow P_{r_{min}}$$   minimum in the performance diagram

Minimum power required

     $$P_{r_{min}} = (D \cdot V)_{min} = \left(\frac{C_D}{C_L}\right) W \sqrt{\frac{W}{S}\frac{2}{\rho}\frac{1}{C_L}}$$

     $$P_{r_{min}} \Rightarrow \left(\frac{C_D^2}{C_L^3}\right)_{min} =  \left(\frac{C_L^3}{C_D^2}\right)_{max} = f(C_L)$$

Minimum power required solution

     $$C_{L_{opt}} = \frac{k_1 \pm \sqrt{k_1^2 + 12 k_2 C_{D_0}}}{2 k_2} $$     (all constant => solution constant)

     $$V = \sqrt{\frac{W}{S} \frac{2}{\rho} \frac{1}{C_L}}$$

**** Speed stability and instability
- positive force/airspeed gradient => stable on induced speed change
- negative force/airspeed gradient => instable on induced speed change
- problem at small speed, pilot or autothrust have to compensate

** Week 7
*** Lecture 3: Climbing and descending flight
**** Introduction
- normal 3 degree descent
- large climb angle vs large rate of climb
- climb angle: object in path
- large rate of climb: reach cruise altitude quickly

Assumptions:
- climb angle $\gamma$ constant, $\frac{d\gamma}{dt} = 0$
- steady flight, V constant, $\frac{dV}{dt} = 0$
- small climb angle, $\cos \gamma \approx 1; \sin \gamma \approx \gamma$
- thrust vector parallel to V: $T \| V \Rightarrow \cos \alpha_T \approx 1, \sin \alpha_T = 0$

    $$\| V: T - D - W \sin \gamma = 0 \Rightarrow $$

    $$\sin\gamma = \frac{T-D}{W}$$      (T, D, W in Newton)

    $$V\sin\gamma = \frac{P_a - P_r}{W} = \mathrm{ROC}$$    (rate of climb)

    $$\perp V: L - W = 0$$
**** Maximum climb angle
- climb angle can't be measured
- observed pitch angle $\theta$
- climb depends on angle of attack: $$\gamma = \theta - \alpha$$

[[./pitch-climb-alpha.png]]

- for low speed, gamma approx 0 and pitch is approx equal alpha
- for high speed, only small alpha needed due to dynamic
  pressure. pitch much lower to get similar climb speed

=> document airspeed of steepest climb

$$L = W$$

$$sin \gamma_{max} = \frac{(T-D)_{max}}{W}$$

$$V \sin \gamma = \frac{P_a - P_r}{W}$$

=> look up in performance diagram (force over airspeed)
=> find point of maximum difference between drag and thrust curve
=> point of lowest drag, optimal $C_L$

Analytically:

    $$C_{L_{opt}} = \sqrt{\frac{C_{D_0}}{k_2}} \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ C_D = C_{D_0} + k_1 C_L + k_2 C_L^2$$

    $$V_{opt} = \sqrt{ \frac{W}{S} \frac{2}{\rho} \frac{1}{C_{L_{opt}}}}$$
**** Minimum descent angle

$$ T - D - W \sin \gamma = 0 $$ (steady straight T = 0)
$$ L = W $$

$$\sin \gamma = -\frac{D}{W} = - \frac{C_D \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S}{C_L \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S} = - \frac{C_D}{C_L}$$    

$$\overline{\gamma} = - \gamma \rightarrow \sin \overline{\gamma} = \frac{C_D}{C_L}$$    (descend angle)

$$\overline{\gamma}_{min} \rightarrow \left(\frac{C_D}{C_L}\right)_{min} \rightarrow \left(\frac{C_L}{C_D}\right)_{max}$$

$$C_D = C_{D_0} + k_1 C_L + k_2 C_L^2$$

To find optimum C_L/C_D, take derivative, equate to 0. Done earlier
for maximum range. result:

$$C_{L_{opt}} = \sqrt{\frac{C_{D_0}}{k_2}} \Rightarrow V_{opt} = \sqrt{\frac{W}{S} \frac{2}{\rho} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{C_{D_0}}{k_2}}}}$$ 

$$\sin \overline{\gamma} = \frac{2 C_{D_0}}{\sqrt{\frac{C_{D_0}}{k_2}}} + k_1$$      (all constants)

-> no weight in the equation, so independent of weight but airspeed
-> has weight in equation, so descent speed is different for different
   weight
**** Maximum rate of climb

$$V\sin\gamma = \frac{P_a - P_r}{W} = \mathrm{ROC}$$    (rate of climb)

In the performance diagram (power over airspeed), choose
airspeed where difference between power required and power
available is max.

Possible to calculate analytically for propeller aircraft,
where we can assum constant power available => use maximum
endurance point for propeller aircraft, which is at minimum
power required


     $$C_{L_{opt}} = \frac{k_1 \pm \sqrt{k_1^2 + 12 k_2 C_{D_0}}}{2 k_2} $$ 

     $$V_{opt} = \sqrt{\frac{W}{S} \frac{2}{\rho} \frac{1}{C_{L_{opt}}}}$$


     $$D = C_D \frac{1}{2} \rho V^2 S \ \ \ \ \ P_r = DV $$

     $$\mathrm{ROC}_{max} = \frac{(P_a - P_r)_{max}}{W}$$

**** Minimum rate of descent
Rate of descent:
     
     $$\mathrm{ROC} = \frac{(P_a - P_r)}{W} = - \frac{D V}{W} \ \ \ \ \ \ P_a = 0$$
     
     $$\mathrm{ROC} = \sqrt{\frac{W}{S}\frac{2}{\rho}\frac{C_D^2}{C_L^3}} \rightarrow \mathrm{ROC}_{max} \rightarrow \left(\frac{C_L^3}{C_D^2}\right)_{max}$$
     
See endurance for solution of maximum $C_L$ (diff, equate to 0):


     $$C_{L_{opt}} = \frac{k_1 \pm \sqrt{k_1^2 + 12 k_2 C_{D_0}}}{2 k_2} $$

     $$V_{opt} = \sqrt{\frac{W}{S} \frac{2}{\rho} \frac{1}{C_{L_{opt}}}}$$

This assumes constant $\rho$. Actually the density and gets higher
closer to ground and rate of descent becomes smaller.

*** Lecture 4: The flight envelope
**** Altitude effects on aircraft performance
- $\alpha$ constant
- $C_L$ constant
- $C_D$ constant
- $L=W$

Force over speed diagram, does drag change with density?
    
    $$ D = \frac{C_D}{C_L} W \neq f(\rho)$$
    
    $$D_{H_1} = \frac{C_D}{C_L} W = D_{H_2}$$
    
    => D is not dependend on air density
    
Force over speed diagram, is speed affected by air density?

    $$V = \sqrt{\frac{W}{S}\frac{2}{\rho}\frac{1}{C_L}}$$

    => lower density needs higher speed
    => curve in performance diagram moves to the right

Power over speed diagram

    $$\frac{P_{H_1}}{V_{H_1}} = \frac{P_{H_2}}{V_{H_2}} = constant$$

    => performance point is moving to the up right while keeping ratio

Effect on propulsion

    $$T = \dot{m} (V_j - V_0)$$

Take off distance example small business jet
    - 0  °C: 2000m
    - 30 °C: 6000m

Modelling propulsion effects

    Thrust: $$\frac{T}{T_0} = \left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)^n$$

    Power:  $$\frac{P}{P_0} = \left(\frac{\rho}{\rho_0}\right)^n$$
**** Performance Limits
Minimum airspeed
- drag-airspeed curve moves to the right with altitude
- available power decreases with altitude
- at some point curves intersect when altitude increases

Maximum airspeed
- drag-airspeed curve moves to the right with altitude
- available power decreases with altitude
- maximum speed can either increase or decrease depending on aircraft
  characteristics

Maximum rate of climb
- distance between power required and power available in performance
  diagram
- with higher altitude, curves get closer and maximum rate of climb
  decreases
- altitude over rate of climb, steadily decreasing line

Performance limits shown in altitude over airspeed diagram
- max altiude max point: theoretical limit
- left edge show stall limit
- right side shows maximum airspeed depending on altitude
- maximum ROC somewhere in the middle

**** Maximum altitude Lockheed U-2
using a one-term lift drag polar here, hence only k instead of k1 and k2

$$\rho_{min}
 = \frac{\rho_s}{T_s} \left(\frac{C_D}{C_L}\right)_{min} W \rightarrow \left(
\frac{C_L}{C_D}\right)_{max}$$


$$C_L = \sqrt{\frac{C_{D_0}}{k}}$$

$$C_D = 2 * C_{D_0}$$

$$\rho_{min} = \frac{\rho_s}{T_s} 2 \sqrt{\frac{C_{D_0}}{\pi A e}} W$$

To fly at high altitude/low density:
=> small aspect ratio      $A$ 
=> small 0-lift drag       $C_{D_0}$ 
=> small weight            $W$ 
=> high thrust at high alt $T_s$
**** Operational limits
Manoevre loads
- L=W horizontal flight
- L>W pull up
- load factor
  $$ n = \frac{L}{W} \rightarrow L = nW$$   expressed in g forces
- flight manoevering envelope, load factor n over Veas
- e.g. commercial aircraft load factor -1 < n 2.5
- cruise speed V_c, +25% design dive speed V_d, stall speed

  [[./flight-envelope.png]]

Aeroelastic effects
- structural deformations
- changes flight characterstics (e.g. wing changes angle or vibrates)
**** Operational limits 2
Gust loads
- change angle of attack
- U gust vectorially added to V
- increases angle of attack

  $$\Delta n = \frac{dC_L}{d \alpha} U \frac{1}{2} V \frac{S}{W}$$

  $$\Delta n = K \cdot U_{gust} * V$$

Design dive speed
  
  $$\frac{1}{2} \rho V_{tas}^2 = \frac{1}{2} \rho_0 V_{eas}^2$$

  $$V_{d,tas} = \sqrt{\frac{\rho_0}{\rho}} V_{d,eas}$$  $$\rho_0$$: alt density $$\rho$$: sea level

  - maximum operating speed lower than dive speed

Maximum Mach number
- factors in lift-drag polar change with mach number
- M_crit is airspeed where air speed on parts of airfoil exceed M=1
- exceeding M_crit cause shock waves
- vibrations
- control surface become less effective
- safety margin, defines max operating mach number

Pressurized cabin
- fuselage designed for maximum differential pressure
- results in maximum flight altitude
- added to flight envelope diagram as well

[[./flight-envelope-2.png]]

[[./manoeuvre-envelope.png]]

**** Flight envelope and instruments
- flight limits are altitude dependent
- hard to monitor

Stall speed
- airspeed indicator
- pitot tube + static port
- pressure difference can be measured
- density unknown
- assume sea-level density
- equivalent air speed
- true airspeed is unknown
- stall speed still correctly shown
- dynamic pressure measure, experienced by the wing, correctly predicts

Maximum operating air speed
- yellow range in air speed indicator
- can be dangerous in bad whether
- can be problem during flight manoevre

Maximum altitude
- static pressure on sea level may vary
- maximum altitude is fixed pressure which can be shown on instrument

Max operating mach number M_MO
- mach number can be determined from static and dynamic pressure

Maximum airspeed limit
- depends on power
- not need to be indicated

**** Advanced topics
Simplifactions done:
- point mass
- point performance

Path performance:
- climbing to 10000m at M=1.5
- involves climbing to 8000m, descending to 7000m to get supersonic,
  accellerating to M=2 and climbing resulting in M= 1.5
- reason is high drag around M=1, dive through sound barrier

Other:
- wind, microburst
- turning performance
